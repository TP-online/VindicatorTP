Primary features:
Config Repo available all the time
You can swap configs anytime
You can have even several local configs, no need to download predefined configs (local profiles)
Vindicator will remember last used config and use it as default on next startup
Clean interface to maintain the configs

Vindicator has unique builds every 15 minutes, which are possible to download via the Information panel or on our website, it's done automatically.

About updates - Vindicator uses signature scanning to find latest offsets & gets latest signatures from UNetAuth, so it's updated instantly after CSGO updates if it's not any kind of huge update like a new operation, in that case it maximally 48 hours as we have to do it manually, but it's usually way faster than that timespan.
